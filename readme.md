## About me

Hello all, I am a 17 year old Web designer, app developer, and graphics artist. Most of my projects are now in the Gameplex-Software Github org. We have over 46 repositories in Github and counting every day. We are a small organization with a big goal: making technology acessable to people of all skill sets and backgrounds.
