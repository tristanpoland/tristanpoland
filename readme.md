## About me

Hello all, I am a 17 year old Web designer, app developer, and graphics artist. Most of my projects are now in the Gameplex-Software Github org. We have over 46 repositories in Github and counting every day. We are a small organization with a big goal: making technology acessable to people of all skill sets and backgrounds.  love developing apps, building websites for people, messing around in Unreal Engine, and playing Minecraft. I also have 11 mod packs (6 soon!) for Minecraft java edition, I put lots of work into them to get them performing as well as possible even on lower performance computers; you can take a look here: https://www.curseforge.com/members/trident_for_u/projects. I can't wait to talk to all of you and hang out. I am always open to learning new things and talking about tech, quantum physics, astronomy, and just about everything else under, in, and around the sun. Check out my company at https://gameplexsoftware.com/
