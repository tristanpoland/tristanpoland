## About me

Hey all! welcome to my crazy little coding corner. I started my adventures here on GitHub in 2017 at age 13. For a while I just used it to observe other people's projects but after a few years I was ready to join in the fun. In Oct of 2020 I made my first public GitHub commit and ever since I have never stopped contributing to open source. I love being involved in eforts to improve the publicly avalible software that individuals and organizations use every day and I am commited to making sure all of my open source projects stay open source. I have tons of fun modpacks for Minecraft in my repos and the Gameplex Software org repos as well as many other projects I find fun and interesting to work on.

More recently I took up Unreal Engine game development and am now working on a project called Unreal Kingdoms! It has been the experience of a lifetime and I can't wait to see where we take it next. Through this experience I have had the oprotunity to not only work in the engine, but also learn more about SQL Databases, ExpressJS, Svelte and many more technologies I had never found the time to try out before. You can check out our site for yourself at: [https://www.unrealkingdoms.com/](https://www.unrealkingdoms.com/) or look at our open source projects and forks at: [https://github.com/Unreal-Kingdoms](https://github.com/Unreal-Kingdoms)
