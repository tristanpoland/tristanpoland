## About me

I am Tristan, I am a Web designer, app developer, and graphics artist based in Niagara Falls NY. In 2019 just before the Covid-19 pandemic I set out to create a software design/hosting company, and here we are in October of 2022 and it's still going. We host websites, game servers, bots, and much more for our clients. Most of my code projects are now in the Gameplex-Software GitHub org in some form or another, but there are a few projects still on my personal GitHub profile. We have over 46 repositories and counting every day (not including our self-hosted repositories at https://git.gameplexsoftware.com/explore/ ). We are a small organization with a big goal: making technology accessible to people of all skill sets and backgrounds. love developing apps, building websites for people, messing around in Unreal Engine, and playing Minecraft. I also have 11 mod packs (6 soon!) for Minecraft java edition, I put lots of work into them to get them performing as well as possible even on lower performance computers; you can take a look here: https://www.curseforge.com/members/trident_for_u/projects. I can't wait to talk to all of you and hang out. I am always open to learning new things and talking about tech, quantum physics, astronomy, and just about everything else under, in, and around the sun.
